# VidShareCodeTest

My entry for the code test.
I chose not to create issues as it is a solo project.


Vue JS frontend (never used before, so very simple!), and a NodeJS backend using axios and AWS.
It's hosted and available at this link [here](https://cosmic-manatee-20361c.netlify.app/)

About the site:
- It takes a file upload from your local machine, and uploads it to an AWS bucket
- Returns a link to the user that is active for one hour which will download the file uploaded
- The deployed version will sometimes take a minute to return a response. This is likely due to the free tier deployments I have, as this issue didn't occur when running locally (still using AWS bucket)
